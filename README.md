# Librify

Librify is a desktop application built with Qt Creator that allows users to manage their book collection. It provides a user-friendly interface for organizing and tracking the reading progress of books. With Librify, users can easily look up books based on their reading statuses, add new books, update book details, and delete books from their collection.

## Features

- **Reading Status Filter**: Users can filter their book collection based on different reading statuses such as "Reading," "Finished," and "To Read." Switching between these filters updates the main controller to display books that match the selected status.

- **Add New Books**: Users can click the plus button on the top bar to add a new book to their collection by providing details such as title, author, description, and cover image. If no cover image is provided, a default cover with the title and author details is created.
